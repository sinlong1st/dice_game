Randomly generated dice game on Android platform

The DiceGameApp
The computer app rolls two dies ([between 1 and 6] using a random number generator), a human player rolls two dies (i.e., the player chooses a number [between 1 and 6], and the app generates a random number for the player), calculate a total number for each party, apply “modulo by 6” to each total number, and who [computer/player] rolls a larger number (after applying “modulo by 6” to the total number) wins.
